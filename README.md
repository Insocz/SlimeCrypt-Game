# SlimeCrypt

## The game
    Its not yet done game that should be open world/dungeon explore type of game.
    You as the player play as a slime in darknes you are lucky beacuse you can see some other creatures cant, but your vision is limited and you are weak your just small slime that is trying to survive.

    Im not sure how many thinks i will add there but some commen rpg thinks i would like to do.
    Like weapons,chest, etc.
    Some weapons will give you light but do less damage so you will have to decide what you want.

    The game is made in c++ with ncurses so its played in terminal.
    For now it work only on linux but i hope that i could make it wotk on windows one day to.
